<h3>
Linda Gilmore Koval was born March 5, 1950 in Syracuse, NY, and passed away, surrounded by the love of her family, on July 18, 2024, in Charleston, WV.<br><br>
Linda spent much of her childhood in Pittsburgh, PA with five siblings, four sisters and one brother. She also met her partner and husband for life in Pittsburg, Joseph James Koval. Linda grew up in the Christian Science faith with a very strict and pious mother, which gave her quite the disciplined side. Joe had a bit more of a wild side in him at first, but he knew he had found someone he couldn't lose when he met and got to know Linda. The two made a perfect pair, traveling the US, camping in the Rocky Mountains, and even spending time together in Spain where Joe was studying. Even now, Joe attributes his ability to finish his bachelor's degree in Spanish to Linda.<br><br>
Linda settled down with Joe in Charleston, WV, where they had two boys, James and Harry. Linda got involved in the local Christian Science church community and made lifelong friends. Linda eventually began working as an academic tutor for West Virginia State University's Student Support Services and Upward Bound program where she helped change the lives of countless students in need. Linda has a bachelor's in biology, and loved to teach and tutor biology at WV State. She also loved the outdoors and wildlife. She would often spend hours sitting outside her home, reading, soaking in the sun, and gardening. She knew the names of all sorts of trees and insects around West Virginia, and she loved to tell you about them.<br><br>
Linda also enjoyed helping out around Charleston. She participated in the construction of the original Celebration Station playground built in the 1990s, where she loved to bring her children to play.<br><br>
Linda is survived by her husband Joe, her two sons, three sisters, one brother, and many nieces and nephews. Everyone loves her and misses her dearly.
